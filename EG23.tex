\section{Intro/specification}

One of the activities of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Fuel Cycle Option (FCO) campaign is
to assess the future of the U.S. nuclear fleet. During the Evaluation and Screening study, 
several alternative fuel cycles were analyzed in an equilibrium state and organized into Evaluation
Groups (EG).  In the current phase the DOE has been interested in assessing a transition from the
current once-through fuel cycle to some of the most promising alternatives from their
equilibrium analysis.

The analysis in this report was conducted after similar analyses performed by the
three fuel cycle simulator codes DYMOND, \cite{dymon}, VISION \cite{vision},
and ORION \cite{orion}. The purpose of this report is to demonstrate the
capabilities of the Cyclus simulator \cite{cyclus} as sufficiently mature to
contribute to ongoing fuel cycle analysis work.

\section{Scenario Description}

The scenario used in this study models the transition from a once-through light
water reactor (LWR) fuel cycle (i.e.\ EG01) to a full recycle case (i.e.\ EG23)
with only sodium fast reactors (SFR).  The LWR and SFR deployments were selected
to accomplish three primary goals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Follow the 1\% annual electricity production curve (Figure \ref{fig:nrg}).
    \item Minimize the amount of sitting separated plutonium.
    \item Transition as quickly as possible given the other goals.
\end{itemize}

The reactor deployment schedule (Figure \ref{fig:deploy}) is part of the problem
specification. It has been taken from a DYMOND calculation by B.
Feng\cite{B.Feng_calculation} and implemented in Cyclus (with some approximation
which will be detailed further in the document).

Other scenario details, including how to represent the problem specifications in Cyclus,
are based on previous work done by R. Carlsen
(https://github.com/rwcarlsen/eg23-sim).  From this study, the configuration
and deployment schedule of the separation facilities for LWR used fuel have
been taken.

        built LWR, R3(red): high BR SFR, R4(purple): low BR SFR. 
        \label{fig:deployment}
    }
\end{figure}

By default, Cyclus facilities exhibit greedy behavior: they request and
process as much material as they can given their inventory capacities and
process throughput limits. As Cyclus does not yet include direct support for on-demand
processing, some special accommodations were made to maintain the desired low
inventory of separated Pu. In order to address this in parts, a series of two
simulations were run:

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Case 1}: A simulation with fuel fabrication deployments
        matching capacity for SFR fresh fuel demand over time, but with
        unrestricted, greedy spent fuel separations.

    \item \textbf{Case 2}: A simulation with separations throughput changing
        over time. Results from the first simulation were used to calculate
        the required separations deployments over time in order to approximate
        on-demand separations.

\end{itemize}

Scenario details for cases 1 and 2 are identical except for the changes noted in
Section \ref{sec:case2}.

The following subsections describe the configuration of the primary facility
types (i.e.\ Cyclus prototypes) used in this analysis.

\subsection{Reactors}

The present simulations start in 2015, with 90 GWe of LWRs using UOX
fuel enriched at $4.2\%$. Prior to the LWR to SFR transition some LWRs are
deployed to sustain the plutonium required for the deployment of the SFR, with a
high breeding ratio. During the LWR to SFR transition, both LWRs and high breading ratio (high-BR) SFRs
are deployed. The last LWR is deployed in 2080 and decommissioned in 2140. In
2180, 30 years after the LWR to SFR transition, lower breeding ratio (low-BR) SFRs
are deployed in order to prevent unbounded buildup of plutonium. 

The properties of the different reactors cores used for the simulation have been
summarized in Table \ref{tab:reactor}. Two different SFR configurations exist to
facilitate management of Pu in later years by reducing the breeding ratio.
Because of the 1-month timestep of Cyclus, the batch quantity and cycle length
parameters have been manipulated to match as closely as possible important
invariants such as fuel residence time, burnup, and discharge rates
\cite{B.Feng_calculation}. The notion of batches is defined in Cyclus by
combining the number of assemblies per core and the number of assemblies per
batch.  In the simplest form, an integer number of batches, $n$, can be defined by
specifying $n$ assemblies per core and 1 assembly per batch.  For a non-integer
number of batches, $f$, can be implemented by specifying $f\times 10^m$ number of
assemblies per core and $10^m$ assemblies per batch, where $f\times 10^m$ is an
integer.  For this problem, it is also possible to select the cycle length,
number of batches and batch size to approximate the same fuel throughput.  This
choice implies small discrepancies between specifications and Cyclus input that
have been detailed below.

For the SFR 1 facility type, the number of batches is specified to be $5.44$
(for discharge burnup of 37.62 GWd/t), $5.40$ has been used (27/5). For the SFR
2, $4.4$ batches (22/5) have been used to approximate the 4.44 batches that were
specified.  In order to maintain the material flow in and out of the SFR reactor
a small correction have been made on the reactor core size by a factor
$5.4/5.44$ for the SFR A and $4.4/4.44$ for the SFR B. This does not affect the
composition of the discharge fuel as the reactor model used for this analysis
does not perform a burnup evolution calculation.

An exact match to the specified number of batches is possible, but
inefficient.  For example, SFR 1 could have been implemented with
$544~$assemblies per core and $100~$assemblies per batch, but this would
result in 20 times as many material objects being traded by the dynamic
resource exchange (DRE), and thus longer runtimes and larger output databases.

All LWR reactors use enriched uranium fuel. The SFR used MOX fuel with
different plutonium enrichments. The input/output fuel recipes are summarized
in Table \ref{tab:reactor_fuel} taken from \cite{B.Feng_calculation}.

\subsection{Cooling/Storage}

After irradiation, all fuel is cooled for 84 months before becoming available
for reprocessing.  The Cycamore Storage facility allows defining a minimum
residence time for each incoming material.  In order to differentiate between
material in cooling and material available for reprocessing as specified in the
reporting requirements, 2 storage facilities are used in series providing this
explicit distinction. One dedicated to cooling, with a residence time of 81
months, corresponds to the output quantity ``Used Fuel in Cooling Storage'', and
one dedicated to storage until reprocessing with no minimum residence time
corresponds to the output quantity ``UNF waiting for reprocessing''.

The implementation properties of the cooling storage can be found in table
\ref{tab:cooling_1}. 
\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{l}{Cooling Implementation}  \\
    \hline
    Residence Time [month]   &  81  \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Cooling facilities core implementation.}
    \label{tab:cooling_1}
\end{table}

The specified cooling time is supposed to be 60 months and a year each for
reprocessing and fabrication. The cooling time has been set to 81 months
because neither separation nor fabrication model any processing time. However, a
time step is required to send the flows from the cooling to the separation and
from the separation to the fabrication and then from the fabrication to the
reactor. In those Cyclus simulations, the minimun time out of reactor is 84 months.

\subsection{Separation}

\subsubsection{Case 1: Greedy Separations}

The LWR fuel separation is handled by three identical separation facilities, two
deployed in 2030 and one in 2040. In Case 1, the SFR separation facilities have
an effectively infinite separation capacity, but the separation rate has been
throttled indirectly using the gradual fuel fabrication capacity growth.  As the
separation output buffers are not limited, those separation facilities will
reprocess all the used available fuel with a constant reprocessing rate. For the
SFR separation the constant reprocessing capacity is so high 
($12\ \text{months} \times5000 tHM/\text{month} = 60000 tHM/\text{year}$) that it will not limit the reprocessing. The used SFR-MOX fuel will
be reprocessed as it discharged from cooling.

As the fuel fabrication facilities have a tuned deployment and capacities (for
10 batches of fuel), the separation facilities' output buffers are the basis for
the ``Fuel Resource in Storage'' result.  The reprocessed uranium is sent after
the separation to a dedicated storage.

Notable are subtle differences in what these two storage facilities data represent
and their exact semantic meaning in the analysis spreadsheet.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lllll}
    \hline
    Separation Implementation  &  LWR        &  SFR 1/2    \\

    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Separation facilities core properties. }
    \label{tab:separation_1}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Case 2: On-Demand Separations}
\label{sec:case2}

The only difference from the Case 1 scenario is the way in which reprocessing
capacity is handled over time.  Modeling on-demand separations is approximated by
deploying many small separations facilities according to plutonium requirements
for SFR fuel fabrication.  These Pu requirements were determined from the Case 1
results. While the calculated deployment schedule does not follow plutonium usage
exactly, it is a reasonable approximation.

For this calculation, all of the reprocessing facilities are based on only
one facility prototype.  When facilities based on this prototype request used fuel
from reactors, they prefer irradiated SFR fuel over UOX fuel. While there is no
preference difference on the used UOX fuel origin (LWR A or B), those
reprocessing facilities prefer used fuel from the lower breeding ratio SFRs
over used fuel from the higher breeding ration SFRs. The implemented
characteristics of each of the reprocessing facilities used in Case 2 are
summarized in Table \ref{tab:fuelfab_2}.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \hline
    Separation Implementation  &  All Fuel   \\
    \hline
    Throughput [tHM/month]     &  60         \\
    Feed buffer [tHM]          &  66         \\
    Pu output buffer  [tHM]    &  6          \\
    Pu separation efficiency   &  0.99       \\
    Recycled U buffer [tHM]    &  Unlimited  \\
    U separation efficiency    &  0.99       \\
    Waste buffer [tHM]         &  Unlimited  \\ 
                                             \\
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Feed commodities}    \\
    \hline
    Commodity Sources         &  Preferences\\
    \hline
    LWR UOX A                 &  3           \\
    LWR UOX B                 &  3           \\
    SFR MOX A                 &  2           \\
    SFR MOX B                 &  1           \\ 
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Separation facilities implementation. (Higher preferences are indicated by lower numerical values.)}
    \label{tab:fuelfab_2}
\end{table}

The Cycamore separation facility requests the feed commodities, accordingly to the
set preferences, to fill its feed buffer. The material in the feed buffer is then
separated following the implemented separation  efficiencies, and all the
unused material is send to waste. The reprocessing rate is limited by:

\begin{itemize}

  \item the feed buffer inventory
  \item the total throughput which limits the amount of material reprocessed from
    the feed buffer,
  \item the output stream buffer size.

\end{itemize}
If one of these parameters reaches its limit the separation is stopped until the
constraint is released, either by the occurrence of the next timestep (for the
throughput limits), or by a change in the buffer's inventory. 

\subsection{Fuel Fabrication}

\subsubsection{UOX Fabrication}

The UOX fuel fabrication is handled by one enrichment facility, the properties
of this enrichment facilities are summarized in Table \ref{tab:enrich_1}. As
explained above, the specification of the enrichment facility has been taken from the
R. Carlsen calculation and might differ from the exact EG01-23 transition
specifications in ways that do not affect the main results.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lllll}
    \hline
    Enrichment implementation  &  UOX        \\
    \hline
    Throughput [tHM/month]     &  Unlimited  \\
    SWU capacity [tSWU/month]  &  Unlimited  \\
    Tails assay                &  0.0025     \\
    Feed buffer [tHM]          &  Unlimited  \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Enrichment facilities implementation. }
    \label{tab:enrich_1}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{MOX Fabrication}

Fuel fabrication for other fuels is implemented with the Cycamore fuel
fabrication archetype that mixes two input streams according to the
plutonium-equivalent theory\cite{Pueq}. A reactivity weight is calculated for
the required output composition and both of the input streams. An interpolation
is used to compute a mixing ratio of the input streams that matches the target
weight.

The SFR fuel fabrication facilities are deployed as a rate of 1 for every 10
SFRs. As the fuel composition and annual material flow change slightly between
SFR 1 and 2, the specifications between fabrication facilities are also slightly
different. The details of all fuel fabrication facility characteristics are
summarized in Table \ref{tab:fuelfab_1}.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lllll}
    \hline
    Fuel Fab Properties      &  SFR 1   &  SFR 2   \\
    \hline

    Pu buffer  [tHM]         &  5.748   &  5.856   \\

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Fuel fabrication facilities properties.}

\end{table}


\section{Results}

\subsection{Case 1: Greedy Separations}

All fuel loading metrics (Figure \ref{fig:ResourceUsed}) are the same or very
close to DYMOND simulation results. There are some observable fluctuations on the
annual fuel loading and the SWU requirements which are consistent with the
synchronized refueling cycles of the initially deployed reactors.  There are
various simple ways to stagger refueling cycles for smoother data that were not
pursued in this analysis.  Similar fluctuations appear as ``echos'' in other
material flows later in time.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \subfigure[Resources Mined]          {\epsfig{figure=img/ResourceMined,width=0.48\textwidth}}
    \subfigure[SWU Requirement]           {\epsfig{figure=img/SWURequierment,width=0.48\textwidth}}
    \subfigure[Annual Fuel Loading Rate]  {\epsfig{figure=img/AnnualFuelLoading,width=0.48\textwidth}}
    \caption{Resources production and fuel loading.\label{fig:ResourceUsed} }
\end{figure}

The generated power and the deployment schedule correspond as expected to the
required one (shown on Figures \ref{fig:deploy} and \ref{fig:nrg}) match
perfectly with results from the DYMOND simulations.

The amounts of the different fuels in ``Used Fuel in Cooling Storage'' (Figure
\ref{fig:UFCS_1}) follow the discharge of the different reactors as expected.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.62\textwidth]{img/usedFuelInCooling}
    \caption{Used Fuel in Cooling Storage}
    \label{fig:UFCS_1}
\end{figure}

The other curves also appear as expected. The annual reprocessing rate (Figure
\ref{fig:ARR_1}) corresponds directly to the deployments. Spent UOX
reprocessing starts in 2010 with 2000 MTHM/yr with another 1000 MTHM/yr added in
2030. This reprocessing rate (UOX1 + UOX2) continues until the end of the
production of used UOX (i.e.\ when all LWRs are decommissioned).
The accumulation of LWR used fuel in ``UNF Waiting for Reprocessing'' is induced
by the limited constant reprocessing capacity for that fuel. The amount of UOX
spent fuel in storage stops increasing when the production rate of used UOX fuel
becomes smaller than its reprocessing rate, i.e.\ when the production rates of used
fuel drops below $3000$ MTHM/yr.
 
MOX spent fuel production by the 2 different SFR types roughly follows the
loading of fresh fuel (see Figure \ref{fig:ARR_1}). Because the reprocessing
facilities are greedy, reprocessing all used fuel available, there is almost no
SFR spent fuel waiting for reprocessing: most of the SFR spent fuel is directly
reprocessed after cooling. The reprocessing capacity of SFR fuel are large
enough to limit the SFR fuel accumulation in ``UNF Waiting for Reprocessing''
(see Figure \ref{fig:FWR_1}).

Before the start of the first SFR, the reprocessing capacities of the LWR fuel
is higher than the demand on plutonium to fabricate the MOX fuel, creating an
accumulation of plutonium prior to 2100, as shown in the Figure \ref{fig:FIS_1}.
After 2100, with the decommissioning of the LWRs and the consequent expansion of
SFRs, less LWRs used fuel is produced, allowing the reduction of the inventory
of plutonium. The reprocessing capacities of the SFR used fuel are adapted to
the demand before 2175, stabilizing the inventory of plutonium around $400~t$.
The plutonium storage rises then up to $800~t$ just before the SFRs switch
to lower breeding ratio (in 2180).
 

\subsection{Case 2: On-demand Separations}

The limitation added on the reprocessing capacities (Figure \ref{fig:ARR_2})
results in a reduction of the inventory of separated plutonium. Indeed, as seen
in Figure \ref{fig:ARR_2}, the reprocessing follows the plutonium need of the
SFR fuel fabrication more closely than in case 1: the accumulation of plutonium
is limited to $\sim750~t$ (Figure \ref{fig:FIS_2}) versus $\sim1500~t$ in the
first case. The deployment of the reprocessing capacity before 2100 seems to be
correct (low plutonium inventories). Nevertheless one can still observe
the two strong phases of plutonium accumulation, 2110-2135 and 2180-2190 that
could have been avoided with a better reprocessing capacity deployment, although
such deployments result in reprocessing facilities that operate at full capacity
for only short periods of time.

Because of both the reprocessing priority and "on-demand" separations
deployment, more LWR spent fuel accumulates waiting for reprocessing with a
quick drop starting around year 2090 as stored up plutonium is used in the first
wave of SFR deployments replacing aging LWRs (see Figure \ref{fig:FWR_2}). Some
of SFR fuel also accumulates waiting for reprocessing, but it eventually
decreases, showing a well designed SFR deployment schedule.

\section{Summary}

This study has shown the capability of Cyclus to properly simulate the EG01 to
EG23 fuel cycle transition.   

Although Cyclus is not currently able to simulate on-demand behavior directly,
it is possible to deploy the different facilities with limited capacities to
"follow" material demand to mimicking an on-demand type of behavior, as shown in
Case 2. There are some small differences in the pattern of fuel
loading (and almost all the reactor fuel metrics), deriving from the way
batches are modeled discretely in Cyclus while in DYMOND all 
material flows are managed in a more continuous way.

The main difficulty encountered during this study was to interpret the meaning
of the output variable such as ``Fuel Resource in Storage'', ``UNF waiting for
reprocessing'', in the context of Cyclus, as well as the conversion of the input specification into proper
Cyclus input parameter. Moreover approximations have been made to reduce the
computing effort, those approximation could have been avoided if a precise
simulation is required.
